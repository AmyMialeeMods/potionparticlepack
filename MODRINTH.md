## Features

Potion Particle Pack is a small mod that enhances a few aspects of how Minecraft Status Effects are displayed on entities.


### Resource Pack Support

Dislike the new potion colours in 1.19.4? Or maybe want to have them in 1.19.2? Or you'd just really like for Jump Boost to be purple?
All potion colours can now be changed by resource packs, with a default one included to swap to the old/new colours.

### Multiple Particle Colours (Requires mod to be installed on server and client)

It's really annoying when you have multiple status effects, and they blend into one awful colour.
Now each potion you have active will show its own colours separately, with higher levels spawning extra particles.

### Effect Icons (1.19.4+)

It can be easy to mix up all your potions, especially when you have multiple of the same effect.
Now when you hold shift, all potions and arrows will show you what effect they have with the icon, so you don't need to check them individually.

### No First Person Particles

When you have a status effect you won't see all those particles in your face anymore.
Helps keep your vision clear, especially helps with permanent effects like those from a beacon.
